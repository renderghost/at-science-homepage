## About Us

**Scientists have been early adopters of Bluesky**, recognising its potential for useful, constructive conversations about their work in an open social media environment where users and communities have better control of their data and experience. But Bluesky is just the start, with a wave of new apps emerging, all underpinned by the [ATprotocol](https://atproto.com/guides/overview) - the same technology used by Bluesky.

### ATScience is a [Community](/people)

Join a network of researchers, developers, and institutions collaborating through interoperable apps. One ATProto account works everywhere—share your work, connect with colleagues, and move freely between platforms while keeping full control of your content and relationships.

**[Meet the ATScience Community &#8594;](/people)**

### ATScience is an [Infrastructure](/projects)

Free, open, democratic protocols owned by scientists. Build and innovate without platform lock-in, where everyone can create better tools and experiences for research.

**[Explore ATScience Projects &#8594;](/projects)**

### ATScience is a [Movement](/events)!

Transforming scholarly communication through collective action. Scientists building platforms and tools that serve research, accelerate discovery, and advance human knowledge.

**[Attend an ATScience Event &#8594;](/events)**

## Get involved, learn more

This is an evolving space, and we're actively learning from the community about what tools and services would be most valuable for you.
