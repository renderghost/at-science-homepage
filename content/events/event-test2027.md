> [!WARNING]
> THIS IS A TEST EVENT - NOT A REAL GATHERING

This is a demonstration event page showcasing the event template functionality. Imagine a small, experimental workshop hosted in Berlin bringing together European researchers interested in decentralized knowledge systems. The focus would be on hands-on collaboration, building prototypes, and connecting with Berlin's thriving open science community.

The hypothetical event would include unconference sessions, collaborative coding sprints, and informal discussions at local cafés. Participants would explore how ATProto could integrate with European research infrastructure and FAIR data principles.

## Hypothetical Speakers

- **Dr. Test McTesterson** - Fictional researcher in decentralized systems
- **Sample Speaker** - Placeholder for template demonstration
- **Demo Presenter** - Example participant profile

## Participation

**Note: This is not a real event.** If this were a real workshop, participants would be invited to propose unconference sessions, share their work-in-progress, and collaborate on experimental prototypes.
