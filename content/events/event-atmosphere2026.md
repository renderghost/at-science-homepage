Join us for a full-day exploration of science and research applications on the AT Protocol. Taking place as a side event to [AtmosphereConf 2026](https://ti.to/atmosphereconf/atmosphereconf2026) in Vancouver (March 26-29, 2026), this gathering will bring together researchers, developers, and builders who are using ATProto for science, education, and open knowledge work.

The event will feature keynote presentations, lightning talks, panel discussions, and demos showcasing projects across the AT Science ecosystem. From academic researchers using Bluesky in innovative ways to new infrastructure for collaborative research and credentialing, we'll explore how ATProto can support transformative new science applications.
