**Join us for a full-day of scientific explorations on the AT Protocol.**

Taking place as a side event to <a href="https://ti.to/atmosphereconf/atmosphereconf2026" target="_blank">AtmosphereConf 2026</a> in Vancouver (March 27, 2026), this gathering will bring together researchers, developers, and builders who are using ATProto for science, education, and open knowledge work.

The event will feature presentations, panel discussions, project demos and an unconference. From academic researchers using Bluesky in innovative ways to new infrastructure for collaborative research and credentialing, we'll explore how ATProto can support transformative new science applications.
