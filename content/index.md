## About Us

**Scientists have been early adopters of Bluesky,** recognising its potential for useful, constructive conversations about their work in an open social media environment where users and communities have better control of their data and experience.

**But Bluesky is just the start,** with a wave of new apps emerging, all underpinned by the [ATprotocol](https://atproto.com/guides/overview) - the same technology used by Bluesky.

That means:

- one "ATproto" account works on all the apps, which can freely interoperate
- you can move freely between them, keeping your content and friends
- no-one is "locked in" to one platform
- everyone can innovate to create better experiences.

**atproto.science is therefore an ecosystem** — a network of scientists and scientific institutions, using a suite of interoperable apps, sharing and discussing their work.

**atproto.science is also an opportunity —** to free science from the stranglehold of extractive scientific publishers and platforms, and to ensure science is not muzzled by corporate social media.

## Get involved, learn more

<!-- Apart from attending our [events](/events), we: -->

- Connect with us on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/atproto.science) and check out the atproto.science Starter Pack, and the custom feeds we're developing there
- Join the discussion on the [ATproto Community Discourse server](https://discourse.atprotocol.community/t/intros-and-kickoff-thread-for-atproto-x-science/156/3?u=mathewlowry.bsky.social)

<!-- ## Themes & Interests

We interpret science broadly — not just traditional academic research, but any form of systematic inquiry, including work by citizen scientists, independent researchers, and self-defined scholars. We're exploring a range of approaches to building this inclusive research ecosystem on ATProto:

- New kinds of science publishing and communication tools (such as Nanopublications or Discourse Graphs)
- ATProto lexicon design for scholarly activity
- Social apps for research communities
- Discovery and curation through better research feeds
- AI applications for scientific work
- ATProto integrations for tools for thought like Obsidian, Notion or Roam.
- Decentralized infrastructure for hosting science data and services

This is an evolving space, and we're actively learning from the community about what tools and services would be most valuable for research on Bluesky/ATProto. Please join the discussion! -->
